              SME IIT(ISM) Students Chapter, an IIT (ISM) Dhanbad student
              chapter of Society for Mining, Metallurgy &amp; Exploration was
              inaugurated in May 2011. It was found with the sole purpose of
              kindling curiosity and interest in the minds of the students of
              ISM about the field of mining engineering. The
              society collectively works in the way of making our presence known
              to the world as a potential body of mining engineers.
