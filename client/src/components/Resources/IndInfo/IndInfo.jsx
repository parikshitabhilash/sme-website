They said that this new framework (2020) will use a life cycle management approach for better efficiency in the mineral value chain process. This framework will focus on both product and processing stewardship. The demand and production of aluminium both have increased at CAGR of 6.77% and 11.19% respectively. This growing demand will also enhance the requirement of coal, a non renewable resource, as this sector is completely energy intensive. Meeting this kind of demand by import will induce a trade imbalance. and recycling is the best option as it consumes 95% less energy than producing primary aluminium. Copper demand in India is expected to grow at 6-7% due to the project like 'Make in India', 'Smart City' etc. As copper is essential for electric vehicles (EV) technology, it will also have a significant effect on Cu demand. To gain control over these circumstances, the country's copper market needs a convincing growth of potential.",
